                <p>
                    Honorable and brave, a knight protects their allies and keeps the attention of the enemy. <br>
                Specializing in heavy armor and weilding a sword and shield, this makes them very durable with a <br>
                high vitaility strength, but low speed and agility. Prefers the thrill of the fight over casting or <br>
                long range.

                <p>
                    Using their faith as their core strength, Priest burn their enemies with righteous fire as well as healing your allies in the <br>
                    same breath. They are a great support, able to give supportive buffs that protect and heal allies. <br>
                    Priest wear light armor making them very weak vs. physical attacks but can resist spells better then a heavier armor types. <br>
                    They have high mana as well as an arsenal of supportive spells.

                <h3>Hunter</h3>
                <p>
                    While using stealth and guile is prefered, Hunters are also a well rounded brawler type. They can disappear and reappear to deliver <br>
                    massive damage from the shadows at range. They, for the most part prefer using a bow,  being a master of the craft it makes <br>
                    them very deadly, but can also be a master of other weapons. Hunters wear meduim armor, give them some protection vs. phisical and vs. magical. Some have even <br>
                    been known to know some simple magics to trick their enemy.

                <h3>Wizard</h3>
                <p>
                    Often bizzare and missunderstood, Wizards are very intellegent masters of their craft. From the Elements, to Time and Space, <br>
                    they do not use a phsical weapon, instead they cast powerful spells that decimate the enemy, leaving conditions on the ones <br>
                    unlucky enough to survive their initial strike. Wizard wear light armor, making them very weak vs. phisical attacks but can <br>
                    resist spells better. Wizards are the strongest with weilding offensive magic.
